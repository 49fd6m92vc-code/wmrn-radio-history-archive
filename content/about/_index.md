# About the Archive

# WMRN Radio History Archive

The WMRN Radio History Archive is an independent historical preservation project dedicated to documenting and safeguarding the legacy of WMRN (AM 1490) and WMRN-FM in Marion, Ohio.

Founded in 1940, WMRN served north-central Ohio for generations through news, music, sports, and community service. Beyond the call letters and the frequency, WMRN was shaped by the people who worked there—on-air talent, engineers, reporters, producers, office staff, and countless behind-the-scenes contributors whose efforts mattered to their community.

This archive exists to preserve that history respectfully, accurately, and in one place.

## Purpose & Scope

Radio history is fragile by nature. Recordings degrade, photographs fade, documents are lost, and personal memories often go unrecorded. The purpose of this archive is to collect, organize, and preserve as much of WMRN’s historical record as possible before those materials disappear.

The scope of the archive includes:

- Station history and timelines  
- People and programming  
- Facilities, studios, and equipment  
- Photographs, documents, recordings, and memorabilia  
- Firsthand accounts and recollections offered for historical context  

This project is not intended to provide commentary, revision, or editorial judgment on past events. Its focus is preservation—not interpretation.

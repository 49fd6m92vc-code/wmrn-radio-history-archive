# Welcome to the WMRN Radio History Archive

The **WMRN Radio History Archive** is a historical preservation project dedicated to documenting the legacy of **WMRN (AM 1490)** and **WMRN-FM** in Marion, Ohio.

Founded in **1940**, WMRN has served north-central Ohio for generations through news, music, sports, and community service. This archive preserves that story through **photographs, documents, audio recordings, ephemera, and original research**.

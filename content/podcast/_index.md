## Recorded Broadcast Collection

*Digitally preserved WMRN-AM and WMRN-FM broadcasts. Historical audio from Marion’s signal since 1940.*

The Recorded Broadcast Collection serves as the official audio access point of the WMRN Radio History Archive. Each release represents a preserved broadcast document, presented with contextual history and archival documentation.

Audio quality, production style, pacing, and language reflect the era in which the material was originally aired. Recordings are preserved intentionally as historical artifacts.

All releases are cataloged within the permanent archival record.

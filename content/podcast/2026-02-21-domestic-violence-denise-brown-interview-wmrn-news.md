# THE WMRN ARCHIVES: 1994-1995 - Domestic Violence: Denise Brown Interview, WMRN News

This episode presents a preserved WMRN News promotional announcement highlighting the station’s interview with Denise Brown, sister of Nicole Brown Simpson.

Produced during the national attention surrounding the O.J. Simpson case, the promo emphasizes WMRN’s role as the only local radio station to bring Brown’s message directly to listeners in Marion, Ohio. The piece reflects how the station connected a nationally significant story to local audiences, framing domestic violence not as distant news, but as an issue of community awareness and responsibility.

The recording illustrates WMRN’s broader mid-1990s newsroom identity — blending national relevance with local engagement and public service reporting.

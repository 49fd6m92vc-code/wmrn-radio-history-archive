## A Timeline of WMRN

### 1940s — WMRN Goes on the Air

WMRN officially signed on the air at **2:00 p.m. on December 23, 1940**, beginning operations on **AM 1490** from Marion, Ohio.

The station’s inaugural broadcast marked the arrival of Marion’s first full-time local radio voice. From its earliest days, WMRN emphasized local news, community information, and public service, quickly becoming an essential part of daily life in Marion and north-central Ohio.

During World War II and the years that followed, WMRN served as a trusted source of information, helping connect the community during a period of national uncertainty and change.

### 1950s — Expansion and the Birth of WMRN-FM

In **May 1953**, WMRN expanded to the FM band with the launch of **WMRN-FM**, representing a major technical and strategic milestone in the station’s history.

In its early years, WMRN-FM primarily simulcast WMRN-AM, a common practice at the time as FM broadcasting was still emerging and FM receivers were not yet widespread. The addition of FM positioned WMRN for the future while maintaining the station’s established AM service.

Throughout the decade, WMRN continued to strengthen its role as Marion’s hometown station, offering music, news, sports, farm programming, and community announcements.

### 1960s — FM Develops Its Own Identity

As FM radio gained popularity nationally during the 1960s, WMRN-FM gradually moved away from full simulcasting and adopted a beautiful music / instrumental format, often historically described as “elevator music.”

This format took advantage of FM’s superior audio fidelity and reflected broader industry trends. Meanwhile, WMRN-AM remained focused on local news, information, and community service, allowing the station to serve different audiences across its AM and FM signals.

### 1970s — Established Voices and Community Service

Throughout the 1970s, WMRN operated as a firmly established dual AM/FM broadcaster.

- **WMRN-AM** continued as a primary source for local news, sports, and public-affairs programming.
- **WMRN-FM** maintained its beautiful music format, providing a calm, music-centered listening experience.

The station’s coverage of local schools, civic institutions, and regional sports further reinforced its identity as a trusted community voice.

### 1981 — A Defining FM Turning Point

On **April 1, 1981**, WMRN-FM made a decisive and permanent format change, transitioning from beautiful music to **country music**.

This shift marked one of the most significant milestones in the station’s FM history. The move aligned WMRN-FM with regional audience preferences and the rapid national growth of country radio.

WMRN-FM has remained a country station ever since, evolving through branding and frequency changes while maintaining its core format.

### 1980s–1990s — Dual-Band Broadcasting in the Modern Era

# Contribute Materials

The WMRN Radio History Archive relies on the collective memory and preserved materials of those who were part of the station’s history—or who safeguarded pieces of it along the way.

Radio history is often scattered across personal collections: photographs in drawers, tapes on shelves, documents in boxes, and memories that were never written down. This page exists to invite the preservation of those materials before they are lost.

## What Can Be Contributed

Contributions may include, but are not limited to:

- Photographs of studios, offices, equipment, events, or staff  
- Audio recordings (airchecks, interviews, news coverage, special broadcasts)  
- Printed materials such as program logs, schedules, memos, press items, or advertisements  
- Equipment documentation or photographs of studio gear  
- Memorabilia related to WMRN-AM or WMRN-FM  
- Written recollections or firsthand accounts  

Materials do not need to be rare, polished, or complete. Even partial information or small details can help fill gaps in the historical record.

## How Materials Are Used

All contributed materials are considered for inclusion in the archive for historical and educational purposes. Contributors retain ownership of their original materials unless otherwise agreed.

Whenever possible, credit will be given to contributors. If you have preferences regarding attribution, privacy, or usage, those can be discussed before anything is published.

Not every contribution may appear publicly, but all submissions are reviewed with care and respect.

## Accuracy & Context

Historical records are sometimes incomplete, and memories can differ. Contributions may be used alongside other materials to provide context rather than definitive conclusions.

Corrections, clarifications, and additional information are always welcome and encouraged.

## How to Contribute

If you have materials, information, or recollections you would like to share—or if you simply have questions about whether something may be useful—please reach out:

**archive@wmrnhistory.com**

A brief description of what you have, along with any known dates, names, or context, is helpful but not required.

## A Note of Thanks

Preserving local radio history is only possible through the willingness of individuals to share what they have kept. Every contribution, no matter how small it may seem, helps ensure that WMRN’s story remains accessible for future generations.

Thank you for helping preserve this history.

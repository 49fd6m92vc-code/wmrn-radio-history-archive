## Contribute Materials

The WMRN Radio History Archive relies on the collective memory and preserved materials of those who were part of the station’s history — or who safeguarded pieces of it along the way.

Radio history is often scattered across personal collections: photographs in drawers, tapes on shelves, documents in boxes, and memories that were never written down. This page exists to invite the preservation of those materials before they are lost.

## What Can Be Contributed

Contributions may include, but are not limited to:

- Photographs of studios, offices, equipment, events, or staff  
- Audio recordings (airchecks, interviews, news coverage, special broadcasts)  
- Printed materials such as program logs, schedules, memos, press items, or advertisements  
- Equipment documentation or photographs of studio gear  
- Memorabilia related to WMRN-AM or WMRN-FM  
- Written recollections or firsthand accounts  

Materials do not need to be rare, polished, or complete. Even partial information or small details can help fill gaps in the historical record.

## How Materials Are Managed

All contributed materials are reviewed for historical relevance and preservation feasibility.

Accepted items are cataloged within the archive and assigned a permanent accession number. When appropriate, materials are digitized for long-term preservation.

Contributors retain ownership of original materials unless otherwise agreed. Loan arrangements for digitization are welcome.

Whenever possible, contributors are credited in the archival record. Attribution preferences, privacy considerations, or usage limitations can be discussed prior to publication.

Not every contribution may appear publicly, but all submissions are reviewed with care and respect.

## Accuracy & Context

Historical records are sometimes incomplete, and recollections may differ. Contributions may be presented alongside other materials to provide context rather than definitive conclusions.

Corrections, clarifications, and additional information are always welcome.

## How to Contribute

If you have materials, information, or recollections you would like to share — or if you are unsure whether something may be useful — please contact:

**archives@wmrnhistory.com**

A brief description of what you have, along with any known dates, names, or context, is helpful but not required.

## A Note of Thanks

Preserving local radio history depends on individuals who choose not to let it fade.

Every contribution, no matter how small it may seem, strengthens the historical record and ensures that WMRN’s story remains accessible for future generations.

Thank you for helping preserve this history.

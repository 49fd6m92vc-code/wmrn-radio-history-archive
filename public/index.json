[{"contents":"Founding of Marion Radio, WMRN Radio station WMRN was established through a carefully planned and professionally executed effort that unfolded during 1940 and culminated in Marion, Ohio’s first locally based radio broadcasts late that year. In the years that followed, the station expanded its service to include FM broadcasting, reflecting broader changes in radio technology and listener habits.\nPlanning and Authorization WMRN was founded by the Marion Broadcasting Company, with Robert T. Mason of Fremont, Ohio, serving as president and treasurer. Mason brought prior experience in broadcasting, publishing, and national news organizations and directed the creation of WMRN as a fully licensed commercial station rather than an experimental or temporary operation.\nDuring mid-1940, Marion Broadcasting Company announced plans to construct a radio station to serve Marion and the surrounding region. After evaluating multiple locations, Mason selected Marion based on its geographic position, civic infrastructure, and ability to sustain a locally focused broadcast service. He emphasized cooperation with civic, educational, and cultural organizations and the importance of programming rooted in local interest.\nThe Federal Communications Commission granted the company a construction permit, authorizing the building of station facilities and a test period prior to the issuance of a full operating license.\nConstruction and Facilities Construction of WMRN’s studio and transmitter facilities began on a site along North Main Street, approximately one-quarter mile north of the Marion city limits. The project was overseen by J. L. McConnell, a Chicago-based engineer, with Robert Archibald of Chicago serving as general contractor. Marion Broadcasting Company stated publicly that as much subcontracting work as possible would be performed locally.\nThe station was engineered as a 250-watt AM facility, originally assigned to 1500 kilocycles on the broadcast band. Its projected service radius was approximately 25 miles, reaching an estimated population of 91,000. The transmitting system included a 65-foot vertical antenna, with electrical power supplied by the Marion-Reserve Power Company.\nIn advance of the station’s launch, Marion Broadcasting Company appointed its initial commercial representatives, establishing an operational and advertising structure prior to the start of regular broadcasting.\nTest Broadcasts and Licensing As construction neared completion, WMRN conducted test broadcasts during early morning hours while awaiting final authorization from the Federal Communications Commission. Station officials had anticipated beginning regular service earlier in December, but final FCC approval did not arrive during the morning hours of the scheduled opening day.\nThe station remained prepared to begin broadcasting immediately upon receipt of federal authorization.\nFirst Regular Broadcast (AM) WMRN officially began regular broadcasting on December 23, 1940. According to contemporaneous reporting in The Marion Star, final FCC approval was received shortly after noon, and the station’s first regular program aired at 1:15 p.m.\nBroadcasting on opening day continued through the afternoon and evening, with WMRN announcing plans for daily operation between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Listeners were instructed to find the station at 1500 on the AM radio dial.\nWith that broadcast, Marion became home to its first radio station, providing a permanent local platform for news, music, public information, and community programming.\nFrequency Change (1941) WMRN originally signed on in December 1940 broadcasting at 1500 kilocycles. In early 1941, the station shifted to 1490 kilocycles as part of the nationwide frequency reallocation mandated by the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), which took effect in the United States in March 1941. This federally ordered change affected hundreds of AM stations simultaneously and was not unique to WMRN. The reassignment placed WMRN on what became a standard local-channel frequency, where it has continued to operate in the decades since.\nExpansion to FM Broadcasting (1953) As radio technology advanced and FM broadcasting gained wider acceptance, WMRN expanded its service beyond AM.\nAccording to reporting in The Marion Star, WMRN-FM began broadcasting on May 6, 1953, when the station placed a new FM transmitter into service at 6:30 a.m. The FM operation transmitted on 106.9 megacycles (FM channel 295) and operated in conjunction with the existing AM facilities.\nThe FM transmitter and a new transmitting tower at the WMRN site had been under construction for several weeks prior to the launch. Initial FM broadcasts were conducted under a temporary permit, pending receipt of a permanent license from the Federal Communications Commission. Hours of operation and programming on FM mirrored those of the AM station during the initial phase.\nThe addition of FM broadcasting marked a significant milestone in WMRN’s development, extending the station’s reach and audio fidelity while reflecting the broader post-war transition toward FM radio across the United States.\nLegacy of the Founding Period From its establishment in 1940 through its expansion into FM broadcasting in the early 1950s, WMRN evolved from a newly constructed local AM station into a multi-band broadcast operation. Its founding and early growth reflect the broader transformation of American radio from a single-band medium into a diversified broadcast service rooted in local communities.\nPrimary sources:\nThe Marion Star, 1940–1953 (construction announcements, licensing coverage, opening-day report, and FM launch coverage)\nEditorial confidence note All dates, times, frequencies, names, locations, and technical details presented here are derived from contemporaneous newspaper reporting and established federal broadcast history.

From its earliest days, WMRN emphasized local news, community information, and public service, quickly becoming an essential part of daily life in Marion and north-central Ohio.\nDuring World War II and the years that followed, WMRN served as a trusted source of information, helping connect the community during a period of national uncertainty and change.\n1950s — Expansion and the Birth of WMRN-FM In May 1953, WMRN expanded to the FM band with the launch of WMRN-FM, representing a major technical and strategic milestone in the station’s history.\nIn its early years, WMRN-FM primarily simulcast WMRN-AM, a common practice at the time as FM broadcasting was still emerging and FM receivers were not yet widespread. The addition of FM positioned WMRN for the future while maintaining the station’s established AM service.\nThroughout the decade, WMRN continued to strengthen its role as Marion’s hometown station, offering music, news, sports, farm programming, and community announcements.\n1960s — FM Develops Its Own Identity As FM radio gained popularity nationally during the 1960s, WMRN-FM gradually moved away from full simulcasting and adopted a beautiful music / instrumental format, often historically described as “elevator music.”\nThis format took advantage of FM’s superior audio fidelity and reflected broader industry trends. Meanwhile, WMRN-AM remained focused on local news, information, and community service, allowing the station to serve different audiences across its AM and FM signals.\n1970s — Established Voices and Community Service Throughout the 1970s, WMRN operated as a firmly established dual AM/FM broadcaster.\nWMRN-AM continued as a primary source for local news, sports, and public-affairs programming. WMRN-FM maintained its beautiful music format, providing a calm, music-centered listening experience. The station’s coverage of local schools, civic institutions, and regional sports further reinforced its identity as a trusted community voice.\n1981 — A Defining FM Turning Point On April 1, 1981, WMRN-FM made a decisive and permanent format change, transitioning from beautiful music to country music.\nThis shift marked one of the most significant milestones in the station’s FM history. The move aligned WMRN-FM with regional audience preferences and the rapid national growth of country radio.\nWMRN-FM has remained a country station ever since, evolving through branding and frequency changes while maintaining its core format.\n1980s–1990s — Dual-Band Broadcasting in the Modern Era During the 1980s and 1990s, WMRN operated as a mature, professional AM/FM broadcast operation.\nWMRN-AM emphasized local news, talk, sports, and community programming. WMRN-FM built a strong and loyal country-music audience. On-air personalities, journalists, and sports broadcasters became well-known figures in Marion, and the station’s newsroom and studios reflected a fast-paced, professional broadcast environment.\n2000s — Technological Transition As broadcasting entered the digital era, WMRN modernized its operations through updated production equipment, automation systems, and evolving workflows.\nDespite industry-wide changes, the station continued to prioritize local coverage, community connection, and service, maintaining the values established at its founding.\n2010s — Recognizing the Historical Record With more than seven decades of continuous broadcasting, WMRN’s long history became increasingly apparent. Attention turned toward preserving the station’s past, including photographs, recordings, documents, and firsthand accounts from both the AM and FM eras.\nThese efforts laid the groundwork for formal archival preservation.\n2020s — The WMRN Radio History Archive The WMRN Radio History Archive exists to preserve and share the station’s legacy across:\nAM broadcasting since December 23, 1940 (2:00 p.m. sign-on) FM broadcasting since May 1953 This is a living project dedicated to documenting WMRN’s people, programming, facilities, and community impact so that its history is preserved for future generations.\nArchival Note This timeline reflects ongoing historical research.
